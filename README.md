# Automatic_cleaning_vehicle_project

Using 9 axis gyroscopes to control the robot posture, so I use the tiltcorrection.

However, it is affected by local magnetic. In addition, I want to make the robot motor can move forward, because the motors don't have same velocity due to hardward problem.
That is the reason why I use the encoder to count the tracks.

What's more, I need to detect the what the trash is, so I use the darknet file, and yolo to train my data I took before.

For the robot, the robot need to know if the obstacles are near or not, so I use the ultrasonic to get the information. Additionally, I need to use it to control 
my robot position to maintain constant distance. In the last step, it's robotic arm. and it is the hardest part for me.

Due to deadline of the project, I cannot finish the robotic arm control, so it is not a completed code.

Do as you please !!!

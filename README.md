# Automatic_cleaning_vehicle_project

Using 9 axis gyroscopes to control the robot posture, so I use the tiltcorrection.
However, it is affected by local magnetic. In addition, I want to make the robot motor can move forward, because the motors don't have same velocity due to hardward problem.
That is the reason why I use the encoder to count the tracks.

What's more, I need to detect the what the trash is, so I use the darknet file, and yolo to train my data I took before.
